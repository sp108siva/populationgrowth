Overview of the Visualization:
This project explores how population growth influences various aspects of countries worldwide. Population changes affect both economic and environmental factors. The following key areas are analyzed in this project:
• Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a major indicator of a country's economic health. In many low- and lower-middle-income countries, GDP growth has not kept pace with population increases, making it harder to support rising expenditures and improve living standards.
• Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Increased population and human activities, such as fossil fuel use, have led to a significant rise in CO2 emissions, which in turn raises global temperatures.
• Forests are vital for climate regulation. However, as populations grow, forest areas have declined, leading to negative environmental impacts such as biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and more frequent floods.

Narrative Flow:
The visualization is structured as an interactive slideshow, allowing users to navigate through different scenes to understand the impact of population growth on GDP, CO2 emissions, and forest area. Users can also explore additional details about population trends by following navigation options provided in the first scene.

Visual Design:
Each scene is presented as a separate web page, using a consistent layout and template for clarity. Key design elements include:
• Scene titles above each visualization to establish context.
• Consistent graph containers and color schemes for similar chart types.
• Pagination to indicate the current scene.
• Uniform background color across all scenes.
• Smooth transitions to help users follow the narrative.
• Graph types are chosen to best convey the data in each scene.

Scenes and Navigation:
The project consists of four web pages (scenes):
• Scene 1 introduces the project, showing how population growth affects economic factors using a scatterplot (population growth % vs. GDP). Users can:
  o Click “Click Here” to explore population growth trends in more detail (scene 2).
  o Use “Next Page” or pagination to skip ahead to other scenes.
• Scene 2 provides a bar chart of population growth by country. Users can go back to scene 1 or forward to scene 3. This scene is more investigative and does not include pagination.
• Scene 3 examines environmental impacts, showing a bar chart of CO2 emission increases by country. Users can navigate to scene 4, return to scene 1, or use pagination.
• Scene 4 focuses on forest area changes over time with a line chart. Users can start over at scene 1, go back to scene 3, or use pagination.

Annotations:
Annotations highlight important data points and trends, helping users draw conclusions. Each scene uses a consistent annotation style. Tooltips appear on hover to provide additional information about specific data points.

User Interaction:
Users interact with the visualization by:
• Navigating between scenes using buttons and pagination.
• Clicking links for more detailed exploration.
• Hovering over data points to view tooltips with country-specific information.
Transitions and triggers are used to maintain context and provide a smooth user experience.

Data Source:
The data for this project comes from the World Development Indicators dataset by the World Bank (https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712). The dataset covers the years 2000 to 2018 and is freely available for use.
